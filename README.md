  Using DBaaS can make the service more reliable. Big companies usually offer strong disaster recovery and backup features. Their network is also more stable. However, this option is more expensive.
  
  Building your own Postgres is harder at the beginning. You have to set up backup and recovery by yourself. But your data stays with you and the cost is lower.

  I think Rancher is better than OpenShift because it isn't tied to one platform. It works like a universal manager that can flexibly control existing Kubernetes clusters on any cloud and any operating system. This completely avoids vendor lock-in. In contrast, OpenShift is more like a closed, complete platform that requires users to accept the full Red Hat technology stack, from the operating system to the toolchain.

  I learned Kubernetes in this course.
  
  I used HELM for package management.
  
  I used Prometheus to monitor the Kubernetes cluster.
  
  I used Istio to manage Kubernetes services in Chapter 6.
  
  I used Argo to automate container deployment in Chapter 5.
  
  I used Google Cloud services in Chapter 4.
  
  I also used GitHub Actions to deploy images.
  
  I used PostgreSQL and Redis as the main databases in this course.
  
  I've also used MongoDB outside of the course.
